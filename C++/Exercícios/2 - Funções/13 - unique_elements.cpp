/*
13- Write a function that takes a vector of integers as input and returns a new vector containing only the unique elements
of the input vector, sorted in non-decreasing order. For example, given the vector {3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3},
the function should return the vector {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9}.
