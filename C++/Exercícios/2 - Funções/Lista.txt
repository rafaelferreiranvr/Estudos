6- Write a function that takes two integer arrays and their sizes as parameters, and returns a new array that is the concatenation of the two arrays.
7- Write a function that takes an integer as parameter and returns true if the number is prime, and false otherwise.
8- Write a function that takes a string as parameter and returns true if the string is a palindrome, and false otherwise.
9- Write a function that takes a double as parameter and returns its rounded value.
10- Write a function that takes a string as parameter and returns a new string with all the vowels replaced by asterisks.
11- Write a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string that contains only the vowels from the original string.
12- Write a function that takes two sorted arrays of integers as input and returns a new sorted array that contains the intersection of the two arrays.
